# Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) with Wazuh Cloud

This project documents my journey from a frustrating starting point to successfully deploying a live Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) environment. The goal was to set up a **Wazuh SIEM** to monitor a Kali Linux machine and gain hands-on experience with a real-world security tool.

---

## üõ† Tools & Technologies Used

- **Kali Linux** ‚Üí endpoint system & attack simulation  
- **Wazuh Cloud (Free Trial)** ‚Üí cloud-based SIEM & EDR platform  
- **Wazuh Agent** ‚Üí endpoint telemetry collection  
- **Nmap** ‚Üí reconnaissance & port scanning  
- **Hydra** ‚Üí brute-force attack simulation  
- **Custom Bash scripts** ‚Üí fake malware / persistence testing  
- **Linux Sysinternals (systemctl, sudo, etc.)** ‚Üí service & process control  
- **Zoho Mail + Custom Domain** ‚Üí business email setup for Wazuh sign-up  

---

## üöß The Challenge
For weeks, I was stuck trying to set up a SIEM. My attempts to host Wazuh on an **AWS cloud server** were repeatedly blocked by billing issues, and every solution I tried with a regular bank card failed.  

I almost gave up ‚Äî but I learned that in cybersecurity, **persistence is everything**.  
My goal was clear: *get a SIEM working, no matter the obstacles*.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Choosing the Right Path: Wazuh Cloud
My breakthrough came when I decided to shift my approach. Instead of self-hosting, I opted for the **Wazuh Cloud free trial**.  

This decision was a game-changer because it eliminated all the issues with cloud hosting and credit card payments. The trial provided a **fully managed SIEM environment** with zero cost.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Overcoming the Business Email Hurdle
Just when I thought I had a clear path, I hit another wall: the **Wazuh Cloud sign-up required a business email address**.  

For a student like me, this was a major roadblock. But instead of quitting, I got creative:  
- I used my personal website (`jmcoded.site`)  
- Integrated it with **Zoho Mail** to create a **legitimate business email**  

This was the key that unlocked the sign-up process.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ SIEM Environment Setup & Agent Deployment
With my new business email, the sign-up process was smooth. Wazuh provisioned my dedicated SIEM environment in just a few minutes.  

A small challenge remained ‚Äî the credentials email didn‚Äôt arrive. I solved this by resetting the password, and boom üí• ‚Äî I was finally in!  

Next step: **Deploy the Wazuh Agent** on my Kali Linux machine.  
<img width="1024" height="576" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2de1822-6ead-4deb-83f2-5e53893961b3" />

### üîπ Agent Installation Procedure
On the Wazuh dashboard:  
1. Selected the **Linux agent (DEB amd64)** for Kali Linux  
2. Copied the generated one-line install command  
3. Ran it on my Kali VM  

The agent installed successfully, but I had to start the service manually.

```bash
# Start the agent service
sudo systemctl start wazuh-agent

# Verify it's running
sudo systemctl status wazuh-agent
```

## üîç SOC Insight: Why This Step Matters
Installing the agent wasn‚Äôt just about ‚Äúmaking it connect.‚Äù  
Here‚Äôs why it matters in a real SOC workflow:

- **Endpoint Visibility** ‚Üí The agent turns my Kali box into a monitored endpoint. Every suspicious process, file change, or login attempt now feeds into the SIEM.  
- **Data Enrichment** ‚Üí Without the agent, Wazuh would only have limited system logs. With it, I get rich telemetry: process creation, file integrity monitoring, vulnerability scans.  
- **Foundation for Detection** ‚Üí This is what allows SOC teams to catch attacker activity *before* it escalates. Without endpoint data, you‚Äôre basically blind.  

In short: this step transforms Wazuh from a ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù into a real **EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) tool**.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ The Final Result: A Live, Connected SIEM
After starting the service, I returned to the Wazuh dashboard.  

After a few minutes, the moment I had been waiting for arrived:  
üëâ My **Kali Linux machine appeared as an active agent**, changing from *‚ÄúNever connected‚Äù* to *‚ÄúActive.‚Äù*  

The months of frustration, late nights, AWS billing issues, and creative problem-solving all led to this victory.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps & Learnings
Now that the SIEM is live, I can move to the **core security work**:  

- üîç **Log Analysis:** Generate events on Kali and analyze them in Wazuh  
- üõ° **Threat Simulation:** Simulate attacks (e.g., failed SSH logins) to test detections  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Rule Creation:** Write custom rules to monitor specific activities

# Attacker Simulation Walkthrough

After finishing the setup, I didn‚Äôt want the lab to stay too clean ‚Äî I needed to simulate a real attacker messing around the system.  
I started dropping noise and testing multiple attack surfaces on the Kali machine.

---

## Recon ‚Äì Scanning the Target

```bash
nmap -sS -T4 192.168.117.3
```

- Open ports: FTP, SSH, Telnet, HTTP, RPC, SMB, MySQL, VNC, X11  
- Older services like ingreslock and RMI also present

---

## Brute-Force Attempt on SSH

```bash
hydra -l 192.168.117.3 -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.117.3
```

---

## üîç SOC Insight: Why These Attacks Matter
Each of these attack steps ties directly to **MITRE ATT&CK tactics** and mirrors what real-world SOC analysts investigate daily:  

- **Recon (Nmap):** Early discovery phase. Alerts help SOCs identify scanning hosts before intrusion.  
- **Credential Access (Hydra brute force):** A common way attackers gain initial foothold. Detecting repeated failed logins is critical.  
- **Privilege Escalation (Shadow file access):** Direct attempt to steal password hashes ‚Äî red flag event.  
- **Persistence (Malware drop):** Attackers drop backdoors/scripts to maintain access. File Integrity Monitoring catches this.

| Attack Step | Detected Alert | Severity | MITRE Tactic | Suggested Response |
|-------------|----------------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Nmap Scan   | Port Scan Alert | Low      | Reconnaissance | Monitor traffic |
| SSH Brute   | Multiple Failed Login | Medium | Credential Access | Block IP if repeated |
| Shadow File | Host Anomaly Event | High     | Credential Access | Review user activity |
| Malware Drop| FIM Alert       | Medium   | Persistence     | Quarantine file |

# The Defender‚Äôs View: Wazuh‚Äôs Real-Time Intelligence

After throwing all that attacker noise at the system, I switched hats ‚Äî from attacker to defender.  
Now it was time to see if my SIEM (Wazuh) could actually pick up the chaos and make sense of it. Spoiler: it didn‚Äôt disappoint.

---
- Total Alerts: 200+  
- Severity Breakdown: 107 Medium, 108 Low  
- Vulnerability Detection: flagged known CVEs  
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: all events aligned

## 1. Triage: The Alerts Dashboard

The first stop was the **main dashboard** ‚Äî and it was already lit.  
This wasn‚Äôt some quiet, sterile lab. It looked alive, like a real SOC environment.

- **Total Alerts:** Over 200 alerts triggered in just a few minutes.  
- **Severity Breakdown:** 107 tagged as *Medium* and 108 as *Low*.  

Right away, Wazuh proved it‚Äôs not just a dumb logger. It was *scoring, ranking, and prioritizing* activity in real time.

---

## 2. Deep Dive: Agent Metrics

Next, I zoomed in on the **agent running on my Kali machine**.  
This wasn‚Äôt just a log forwarder ‚Äî it acted like a mini-EDR.

- **Vulnerability Detection:** It scanned installed software and flagged known CVEs, giving me proactive defense data.  
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** Events were mapped to ATT&CK tactics, showing exactly how actions lined up with real-world adversary playbooks.  

That‚Äôs pro-level visibility, and it‚Äôs built right in.

---

## 3. Live Detection: `/etc/shadow` Access

One of my biggest tests was whether Wazuh would catch me reading `/etc/shadow`.  
That‚Äôs a **red-flag attacker move** every SOC analyst looks for.

And it did:

- **Rule Level:** 7 (high-severity anomaly).  
- **Description:** ‚ÄúHost-based anomaly detection event‚Äù ‚Äî simple, clear, accurate.  

This wasn‚Äôt noise. It was exactly the kind of crisp alert a SOC analyst wants.

---

## 4. File Integrity & Malware Detection

Last move: I dropped my fake malware script (`/bin/badscript.sh`) into a critical directory.  
If Wazuh missed this, the whole setup would be questionable.  

But it didn‚Äôt miss.  
The **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) module** immediately flagged the change as suspicious ‚Äî exactly how attackers are caught trying to persist in systems.

# Final Conclusion & Key Takeaways

Completing this project provided a critical look at the full cybersecurity lifecycle, from attacker to defender. While platforms like Splunk offer immense power‚Äîwith a high price tag and steep learning curve‚Äîmy goal was to demonstrate that an effective, professional-grade SIEM/EDR can be built entirely with open-source technology.

This project successfully showed that:

- **You don‚Äôt need a multi-million-dollar budget to detect sophisticated attacks.**  
- **The true power of a SIEM lies in accurately classifying events and generating actionable alerts**, not just flashy interfaces. Wazuh‚Äôs clear, metric-driven dashboards logged over 200 security events and correctly classified attacker activity.  
- **Real-world problem-solving outweighs theoretical knowledge.** Troubleshooting the cloud environment, configuring the agent, and validating results with concrete data showcased practical skills.

**Future Improvements / Next Steps:**

- Integrate additional log sources (cloud services, network devices, endpoint logs)  
- Build custom dashboards for real-time monitoring of critical events  
- Implement automated response workflows for high-priority alerts  
- Explore machine learning-based anomaly detection to enhance threat visibility  

üöÄ *From frustration to a live SIEM ‚Äî this project is proof that persistence pays off.*
